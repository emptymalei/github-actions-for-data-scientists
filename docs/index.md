# GitHub Actions for Data Scientists

We provide some examples of utilizing [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to simplify some work for data scientists.

The code and GitHub Actions can be found in [emptymalei/github-actions-for-data-scientists](https://github.com/emptymalei/github-actions-for-data-scientists).

This is a demo of building [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) sites using GitHub Actions. Most of the pages are nothing more than placeholders.
